## Core Knowledge-Action Framework

### Foundational Understanding

#### Core Principles

- **Knowledge-Action Relationship**: Beneficial knowledge requires implementation to reach full benefit
- **Knowledge Hierarchy**: Different types of knowledge have different values and implications
- **Implementation Imperative**: Knowledge creates obligation for appropriate action
- **Comprehensive Responsibility**: Both knowledge acquisition and application are individual duties
- **Transformative Integration**: True integration transforms heart, mind, behavior and identity

#### System Structure

- **Knowledge Components**:

  - Theoretical understanding (فهم نظري)
  - Conceptual comprehension (استيعاب مفاهيمي)
  - Factual information (معلومات واقعية)
  - Procedural knowledge (معرفة إجرائية)
  - Experiential wisdom (حكمة تجريبية)

- **Action Elements**:

  - Intentional implementation (تطبيق متعمد)
  - Consistent practice (ممارسة متناسقة)
  - Habitual integration (تكامل عادي)
  - Environmental application (تطبيق بيئي)
  - Identity embodiment (تجسيد هوية)

- **Integration Components**:
